Senior Research Project
Objective

The objective of this senior research project is to investigate student preferences between AI chatbots (such as ChatGPT and Gemini) and traditional search engines (such as Google and Bing) when conducting academic research. The project aims to analyze how students perceive each tool in terms of credibility, convenience, accuracy, and usefulness for scholarly purposes.

Background

With the rise of generative AI, tools like ChatGPT and Gemini have become widely used for information gathering and learning support. Unlike traditional search engines that direct users to original sources, AI chatbots synthesize responses instantly, potentially reducing exposure to source material. Understanding how students balance these tools in academic research contexts can reveal changing information-seeking behaviors and highlight areas where AI literacy and source evaluation skills are needed.

Methodology

A 20-question online survey will be administered to a sample of university students.

Questions 1â€“19 consist of multiple-choice items comparing chatbot and search engine usage across factors such as speed, credibility, and depth of information.

Question 20 is open-ended, asking students to explain their preferred tool and reasoning.
Quantitative responses will be analyzed using frequency counts and bar graphs, while qualitative responses will undergo thematic coding to identify recurring patterns in reasoning.

Expected Outcome

The study is expected to show that students continue to favor traditional search engines for academic work due to their direct access to cited sources and perceived credibility. However, AI chatbots may be preferred for quick summaries and conceptual understanding. The results will help educators and institutions recognize evolving research habits and reinforce the importance of teaching AI literacy and source evaluation in academic contexts.
